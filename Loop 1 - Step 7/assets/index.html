              Chief Olusegun Matthew Okikiola Aremu Obasanjo, GCFR,[1][2] 
              (/oʊˈbɑːsəndʒoʊ/; Yoruba: Olúṣẹ́gun Ọbásanjọ́ [olúʃɛ̙́ɡũ ɒ̙básandʒɒ̙́];[3]
               born 5 March 1937) is a Nigerian political and military leader who
                served as Nigeria's head of state from 1976 to 1979 and later as
                 its President from 1999 to 2007. Ideologically a Nigerian nationalist,
                  he was a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) from 1999 to 
                  2015 and again from 2018 onward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born in the village of Ibogun-Olaogun to a farming family of the Owu branch of the Yoruba, 
              Obasanjo was educated largely in Abeokuta. Joining the Nigerian Army, where he specialised 
              in engineering, he spent time assigned in the Congo, Britain, and India, rising to the rank 
              of major. In the latter part of the 1960s, he played a senior role in combating Biafran separatists
               during the Nigerian Civil War, accepting their surrender in 1970.
               In 1975, a military coup established a junta with Obasanjo as part of its ruling triumvirate.
